# BaiduBaike-Crawler-with-DFS
A web crawler using Deep First Search (DFS) algorithm to collect items @https://baike.baidu.com. Quite interesting stuff for practicing writing crawlers.
## How to Use
1. install relative package according to <PATH-TO-YOUR-CURRENT-WORKING-DIRECTORY>/requirements.txt
```bash
pip install -r <PATH-TO-YOUR-CWD>/requirements
```
2. execute main.py file and there your go!!!
```bash
<YOUR-PYTHON-3.9-iNTERPRETER> main.py
```
3. data files wil be stored in `<CWD>/data/`, I made csv the default output format , and you can switch it to txt in cfg.py. Furthermore, the max depth of DFS Tree can be modified in the exact file.

*P.S. I never tried any other version of python3 on my PC(Mine is 3.9.7), so wish you luck :p*
## Further Help
I made this repo for a in class project of a Big Data Course and some of my pals' 'well-being'. I would have to say for some part of
the code I made it a bit tricky deliberately to learn some more of python so if this makes you hard to understand the main logic of my code
